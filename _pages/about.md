My research interests lie in operations research and decision-making for urban logistics, with an emphasis on optimization and learning-augmented algorithms for real-world and large-scale optimization problems (e.g., vehicle routing problems, machine scheduling problems).

I am currently a Master's student in Management Science and Engineering at [Tianjin University(TJU)](https://www.tju.edu.cn/) since the fall of 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Zhaofang Mao](https://come.tju.edu.cn/info/1539/5758.htm). I also received my Bachelor's degree at [Tianjin University(TJU)](https://www.tju.edu.cn/) in 2023.

I have worked on the model inversion attacks on discrete choice models (DCMs) under the supervision of [Dr. Baichuan Mo, MIT](https://www.mit.edu/~baichuan/index.html). This project is part of the MIT-UF-NU summer research camp, and is being undertaken in collaboration with [Prof. Jinhua Zhao, MIT](https://mobility.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao/), [Prof. Haris Koutsopoulos, NEU](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/koutsopoulos-haris/), [Prof. Shenhao Wang, UF](https://dcp.ufl.edu/urp/people_wang_s/) and [Dr. Dingyi Zhuang, MIT]([https://www.mit.edu/~baichuan/index.html](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/)). 

I have worked on Sustainable Operations in Urban Logistics (SOUL) program colloborated with [Prof.Jan Fransoo, Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/jan-fransoo), [Prof. Walid KLIBI, Kedge Business School](https://student.kedge.edu/faculty-directory/walid-klibi), [Prof. Lei Zhao, Tsinghua University](https://www.ie.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/info/1051/1016.htm)  and [Prof. Zhaoxia Guo, Sichuan University](https://bs.scu.edu.cn/gongye/201904/5203.html).

I have worked on the data-driven parallel machine scheduling problems in company L under the supervision of [Prof. Kan Fang, TJU](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/FangKan/en/index.htm).

Currently, I am actively seeking PhD opportunities to develop challenging and inspiring ideas at the intersection of operations research and machine learning. At the same time, I remain broadly excited about other operations research topics and am open to exploring diverse OR-related problems!
